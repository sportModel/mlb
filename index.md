Statistics are posted for the following seasons:

* [2018](2018/teams.html)
* [2017](2017/teams.html)

Statistics for each season are available in two formats: by team and by position.  The team pages tell a story about which players on the team have contributed the most to the team's win/loss record.  The position pages inform us about which players have been the best and worst in MLB at their respective positions.
